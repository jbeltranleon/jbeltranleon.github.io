    In the project, Selection of Deep Neural Network Model (Deep Learning) optimal for the
    recognition of diseases using <mark>X-ray</mark> images, includes the resolution of a practical problem in the
    medical field in which an optimal and simple model is proposed that allows the classification of
    a list of recognizable diseases by a <mark>convolutional neural network</mark>. All these experiments were
    performed over a cloud. Finally, a comparison is made between the scores thrown by the trained
    models of other investigations, giving as conclusion that the chosen model is at the level of the
    current state of the art for this problem and group of data.
