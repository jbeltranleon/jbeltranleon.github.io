  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    In the project, Selection of Deep Neural Network Model (Deep Learning) optimal for the
    recognition of diseases using <mark>X-ray</mark> images, includes the resolution of a practical problem in the
    medical field in which an optimal and simple model is proposed that allows the classification of
    a list of recognizable diseases by a <mark>convolutional neural network</mark>. In this way, the project is
    covered through different stages that allow a semi-sequential resolution, which gives greater
    traceability to the experiments that are executed to recognize the architecture that has better
    adaptation, therefore, better performance against the problem. All these experiments are
    performed under a cloud environment that allows more power when training models that demand
    a lot of resources. Finally, a comparison is made between the scores thrown by the trained
    models of other investigations, giving as conclusion that the chosen model is at the level of the
    current state of the art for this problem and group of data.
